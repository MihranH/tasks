\f0\fs28 \cf0 1) We may have \'91Company\'92 table where name and domain can be stored. So each company should serve games from its specific domain given the id of company.\
2) In users table we should store companyId which is a foreign key to the \'92Company\'92 table, by that we will know which user is from which company.\
3) While validating a user we should consider the user from the session (or from JWT, etc), and check if the domain from where the request is coming is the domain that the user\'92s company has, if yes then the user is authenticated, otherwise no.}
